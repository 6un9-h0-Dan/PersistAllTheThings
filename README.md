# PersistAllTheThings

This is my attempt at documenting everything I possibly can regarding
persistence in cyber security engagements. Most practice methods I've
come across tend to remove the human element of capture the flag,
considering that most of the time if you are participating in these
wargames you generally don't have to hide your tracks or remain
undetected. This document will be something I hope to contribute to as
often as possible relating to tricks I've used or at least hope to use
in further engagements.

This came about after my participation in the Department of Energy's
annual Cyberforce Competition. I've created several means to establish
and maintain persistence, as well as learned a few tips and tricks along
the way.
